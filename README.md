# Dotty Dinosaurs, Orchard Toys

[Orchard Toys](https://www.orchardtoys.com/) have developed a very simple game that my (as of writing) 3 year old child loves, called [Dotty Dinosaurs](https://www.orchardtoys.com/buy/dotty-dinosaurs-game_48.htm)

There are two ways you can play the game.  

In one version of the game, you roll the six sided dice of colours.  You then pick up the coloured disc and place it on your dinosaur (if you didn't already have that colour).
The winner is the first to 'complete' their dinosaur.

I started this repo as I was interested in testing out a theory I had that my 3 year old wins, because they go first. I was interested to see what the statistics were on this, depending on your starting position.
